        Hi. My name is Isak, and I am a developer. I have been programming
        since 2013, and I've more recently found a love for front-end development.
        I love learning about new technologies, and improving as a developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I started out programming in python. Since then, I have specialized
        in JavaScript, HTML and CSS as a front-end developer.
